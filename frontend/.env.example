# API base URL used by the frontend axios client.
# Defaults to "/api" (relative), which works when the frontend is served behind
# a reverse proxy that forwards /api/* to the backend (e.g. nginx in production
# or the Vite dev server proxy in development).
# Set this to an absolute URL when the frontend and backend are on different origins,
# e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/api
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
